\section{Iterations} 
\subsection{Sprint 1}
\subsubsection{Plan}
In this sprint we aimed to get a simple working version of Blackjack that runs from a GUI. \\

\noindent We added 6 (Main, card, deck, hand, player, and game).java that serves as our business logic for our game. Additionally we added a login screen that allows the user to sign in, create an account, or play as a guest. We have also implemented the base for our backend database that stores our users login info.

\subsubsection{Retrospective}
We realized that integration between model, view and controller can take much more time than anticipated. Additionally, some of our original point values for our user stories might have been underestimated.
