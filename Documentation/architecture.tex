\section{Final System Architecture and Design}

\subsection{System Architecture}
Based on our project's requirements and the components involved, we have decided to use the MVC architecture for our project. We believe that the MVC architecture will best let us integrate the major parts of our project (Web UI, functional logic, and database) effectively.

\subsection{Libraries, Modules \& Packages}
So far, we haven't figured out all the libraries and packages we will need for the project. They will be added on a as-needed basis and will be put here.

\subsection{Coding Standards}
\subsubsection{Comments}
Comments (outside of function headers) will always be above the line of code it pertains to, never on the same line. We will aim to keep comments clear, concise and in plain-english.

\subsubsection{Headers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Function Headers \\
    For functions, we will have consistent headers (in plain-english) including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [--] Input: what the function receives as input.
        \item [--] Output: what the function produces.
        \item [--] Purpose: what the function does.
        \item [--] Reliance: function that directly relies on this function, and function that this function directly relies on if any. (for testing purposes)
    \end{itemize}

    \item File Headers \\
    For file headers we will have a brief description of what the file is and what it contains.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Variables}
Following the same standard across all of our code, all variables will be camel case and singular. This guarantees consistency in all variable nomenclature. 

\subsubsection{Database}
For our database, our table names will be Pascal case and singular. The primary keys in our database will be camel case followed by 'ID'. The foreign keys will also be camel case with a descriptor followed by 'FK'.\\

Here is an ER diagram of our database:

\end{figure}

\subsection{Technologies Used}

\subsubsection{Languages}
For the language to run our functional logic we have chose Java as it integrates well with the other languages in our project. For our database components we will be using MySQL along with MySQL community server and MySQL workbench. For our web UI we will be using React along with Next JS for our server.

Here is our UML class diagram that outlines the major classes and relations in our software:

\subsection{UI Mockups}
Here are some of the initial UI designs for our project:
