\section{\colorbox{violet}{Testing}}
%[[ include test plan and coverage data

For our testing we will be using JUnit. We will be focused on writing good tests rather than achieving a set percentage required to commit. We believe that this is a reliable way to ensure that good software is being developed. However, if we \textit{had} to give a numerical value, we decided that 80\% coverage would be sufficient to commit.\\

Across each sprint, the average branch coverage for the whole project was:
